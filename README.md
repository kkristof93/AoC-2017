# Advent of Code 2017

This year I decided to solve the Advent of Code challenges. To make this more fun and diverse, I use different programming languages every 5 days. This repo contains my solutions.

> Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme. ([Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com))
